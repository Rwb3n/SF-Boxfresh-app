# Minimal Consolidation Plan

This lightweight consolidation plan focuses only on the essential changes needed to support the Theory of Constraints implementation without extensive restructuring.

## Current Structure Assessment

The current project contains:
- Multiple documentation files in `/docs/`
- Legacy files in `/01_start-here/`, `/02_diving-in/`, and `/03_real-build/`
- Images in `/img/`

## Minimal Changes Required

### 1. Documentation Updates

- ✅ Keep all existing documentation in current locations
- ✅ Update only `workflow.md` and `schema.md` for TOC principles
- ✅ Add the three new documents already created:
  - `Proposal.md`
  - `Status.md`
  - `Sprint-Plan.md`

### 2. Folder Structure

- ✅ No changes to existing folders
- ✅ No creation of new folders
- ✅ No file migrations

### 3. README Update

- ✅ Add links to new TOC documentation
- ✅ Update project description to mention TOC approach
- ✅ No structural changes to README

## Implementation Approach

1. **Documentation-Only Changes**
   - Focus on updating existing files in place
   - Add new files only where essential
   - Keep all file paths consistent

2. **Reference Integrity**
   - Ensure any new document references existing locations
   - Update links in modified documents
   - No changes to existing URL structures

3. **Minimize Disruption**
   - Make no changes to existing numbered folders
   - Keep all image references intact
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing links

## Essential Tasks (1-2 Days)

1. **Update Core Documents**
   - Update `schema.md` with capacity fields
   - Update `workflow.md` to remove expiry and add TOC

2. **Add New Documentation**
   - Ensure all three new documents are accessible
   - Add links from existing documentation 

3. **Validate**
   - Check all links work
   - Verify consistency in TOC terminology

## Future Considerations

After this sprint, evaluate whether a more comprehensive restructuring is needed based on:
- Feedback on documentation clarity
- Continued development needs
- Growing complexity of documentation

This minimal approach ensures we can make progress on implementing TOC principles without introducing additional complexity through extensive restructuring at this stage.
