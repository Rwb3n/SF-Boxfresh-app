# Documentation Consolidation Initiative

*Last Updated: April 4, 2025*

## Overview

The Documentation Consolidation Initiative is a structured effort to reorganize and improve the BoxFresh app documentation. This initiative aims to create a more consistent, navigable, and maintainable documentation structure to support both current and future development efforts.

## Current Status

**April 4, 2025**: We have completed the planning phase and directory structure setup. All index files have been created, establishing the navigation hierarchy for the documentation. The next phase is content migration, which will begin on April 5, 2025.

| Milestone | Status | Due Date |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Planning | ✅ Completed | April 3, 2025 |
| Directory Structure & Navigation | ✅ Completed | April 4, 2025 |
| Content Migration | ⏳ Scheduled | April 5-7, 2025 |
| Content Review | ⏳ Scheduled | April 8, 2025 |
| Gap Analysis | ⏳ Scheduled | April 9, 2025 |
| Deprecation | ⏳ Scheduled | April 10, 2025 |
| Final Review | ⏳ Scheduled | April 11, 2025 |

## Motivation

As the BoxFresh app has evolved, our documentation has grown organically across multiple directories and formats. This has led to several challenges:

- **Fragmented Information**: Related documentation is spread across different locations
- **Inconsistent Structure**: Different documentation follows different formats and styles
- **Navigation Difficulties**: Finding specific information requires prior knowledge of where it might be
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Updating documentation across multiple locations is error-prone

The consolidation initiative addresses these challenges by creating a unified, well-structured documentation system.

## Key Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Consolidation Plan](consolidation-plan.md) | Outlines the overall plan for documentation consolidation |
| [File Mapping](file-mapping.md) | Details which files will move where during consolidation |
| [Progress Tracking](progress.md) | Tracks the status of the consolidation effort |

## Timeline

The documentation consolidation is scheduled for April 3-11, 2025, with specific milestones outlined in the [Consolidation Plan](consolidation-plan.md).

## Contributing

During the consolidation period, please coordinate with the Documentation Team before making significant changes to documentation. This will help prevent conflicts and duplicate efforts during the reorganization process.

If you identify documentation that should be included in the consolidated structure but isn't currently mapped, please contact the Documentation Team to update the [File Mapping](file-mapping.md).
