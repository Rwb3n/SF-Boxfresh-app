## Next Steps

1. **Complete Index Files Creation** - Finish creating any remaining index files
2. **Start Core File Migration** - Begin with schema and architecture
3. **Continue Implementation Guide Migration** - Focus on capacity implementation
4. **Update Progress** - Update this document as tasks are completed
