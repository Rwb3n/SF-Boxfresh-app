# Project Status 
Last updated: April 3, 2025

## Theory of Constraints Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation status of the Theory of Constraints (TOC) approach to inventory capacity management in the BoxFresh app.

## Completed Items âœ…

### Documentation
- âœ… Updated `schema.md` to document capacity fields
- âœ… Revised `workflow.md` to focus on container capacity management
- âœ… Added TOC references to `index.md` and `README.md`
- âœ… Created `Proposal.md` for TOC implementation strategy
- âœ… Created `Sprint-Plan.md` for implementation timeline
- âœ… Created `Minimal-Consolidation.md` to document approach
- âœ… Created implementation guides for capacity fields:
  - âœ… `inventory_fields.md` for Inventory__c capacity fields
  - âœ… `material_stock_fields.md` for Material_Stock__c capacity fields
  - âœ… `assignment_junction.md` for Assignment__c relationship
  - âœ… `capacity_check_flow.md` for validation flow
  - âœ… `container_update_flow.md` for container updates
- âœ… Created next phase planning documents:
  - âœ… `next-phase/Proposal.md` for user access, cases, and reporting
  - âœ… `next-phase/Status.md` for tracking next phase progress
  - âœ… `next-phase/Sprint-Plan.md` with detailed implementation timeline
- âœ… Created documentation consolidation plan:
  - âœ… `consolidation/Proposal.md` for documentation restructuring
  - âœ… `consolidation/Sprint-Plan.md` with consolidation timeline
  - âœ… `consolidation/Status.md` for tracking consolidation progress
  - âœ… `consolidation/index.md` landing page for the initiative

### Schema Design
- âœ… Identified capacity fields for Inventory__c
- âœ… Identified capacity fields for Material_Stock__c 
- âœ… Documented Assignment__c as junction object

## Current Sprint Status

| Task | Status | Due Date |
|------|--------|----------|
| Documentation: Update schema.md | âœ… Completed | Mar 27 |
| Documentation: Update workflow.md | âœ… Completed | Mar 27 |
| Documentation: Create implementation guides | âœ… Completed | Mar 28 |
| Documentation: Create next phase planning | âœ… Completed | Apr 2 |
| Documentation: Create consolidation plan | âœ… Completed | Apr 3 |
| Implementation: Add capacity fields to Inventory__c | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Apr 2 |
| Implementation: Add capacity fields to Material_Stock__c | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Apr 2 |
| Implementation: Enhance Assignment__c junction | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Apr 4 |
| Implementation: Create Capacity Check Flow | ðŸ“… Planned | Apr 6 |
| Implementation: Create Container Update Flow | ðŸ“… Planned | Apr 8 |
| Implementation: Create capacity dashboard component | ðŸ“… Planned | Apr 10 |

## Next Steps
1. Complete the implementation of capacity fields on Inventory__c and Material_Stock__c objects
2. Build validation rules to enforce capacity constraints
3. Implement flows for capacity management, beginning with the Capacity Check Flow
4. Create dashboard components for visualizing capacity utilization
5. Conduct thorough testing of all components
6. Complete documentation consolidation (April 3-11)
7. Begin design phase for next implementation sprint (user access, cases, and reporting)

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Capacity Management (Current)
- **March 27 - April 10, 2025**: Implementation of TOC capacity fields and flows

### Documentation Consolidation
- **April 3 - April 11, 2025**: Restructuring and enhancement of documentation
  - Phase 1: Directory Restructuring (April 3-4)
  - Phase 2: Content Consolidation (April 5-9)
  - Phase 3: Documentation Enhancement (April 10-11)

### Phase 2: User Access, Cases, and Reporting (Pending Consolidation)
- **April 12 - May 17, 2025**: Implementation of user security, case management, and dashboards
  - Sprint 1: Design & Foundation (April 12-25)
  - Sprint 2: User Security Implementation (April 26-May 9)
  - Sprint 3: Automation & Dashboards (May 10-17)

See `consolidation/Sprint-Plan.md` for consolidation schedule and `next-phase/Sprint-Plan.md` for Phase 2 details.

## Important Note

The documentation consolidation effort must be completed before beginning Phase 2 implementation. The current capacity management implementation work will continue in parallel with the documentation consolidation.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Complex capacity calculations may impact performance | High | Medium | Consider using Apex triggers for performance-critical operations |
| Users may find new capacity constraints restrictive | Medium | Medium | Provide clear documentation and training on the benefits |
| Integration with existing inventory processes | Medium | High | Phase implementation and thoroughly test all scenarios |
| Data migration for existing records | High | Medium | Create a data migration plan with careful validation steps |
| Documentation consolidation may delay Phase 2 start | Medium | Low | Dedicated documentation team working in parallel with implementation |
