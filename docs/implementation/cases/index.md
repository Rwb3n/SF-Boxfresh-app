# Case Management Implementation

This section provides implementation guides for case management features in the BoxFresh app.

> **Note:** Case management implementation is scheduled for Phase 2 (April 12 - May 17, 2025) following the documentation consolidation initiative.

## Planned Implementation Components

The case management implementation will focus on:

- **Case Creation and Assignment** - Implementing automated case creation and assignment processes
- **Service Level Agreements** - Configuring SLAs for different case types
- **Escalation Rules** - Setting up escalation paths for unresolved cases
- **Case Templates** - Creating templates for common case types
- **Customer Communication** - Implementing client notification workflows for case updates

## Implementation Approach

The case management implementation will follow these key principles:

- **Client-Centric** - Cases will be managed with client satisfaction as the primary goal
- **Efficient Resolution** - Processes will be designed to minimize resolution time
- **Knowledge Capture** - Case resolutions will feed into a knowledge base for future reference
- **Integration with Field Operations** - Cases will be linked to field operations where appropriate

## Documentation Consolidation

This section is part of the [Documentation Consolidation Initiative](../../project/consolidation-status.md) (April 3-11, 2025). Content placeholders are being created in preparation for Phase 2 implementation.
