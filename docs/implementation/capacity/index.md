# Capacity Management Implementation

This section provides comprehensive implementation guides for the Theory of Constraints (TOC) capacity management system in the BoxFresh app.

## Implementation Components

The capacity management implementation consists of the following components:

- [Inventory Capacity Fields](./inventory.md) - Implementing container capacity fields on Inventory__c
- [Material Stock Capacity Fields](./stock.md) - Implementing capacity consumption fields on Material_Stock__c
- [Assignment Junction Relationship](./junction.md) - Configuring Assignment__c as a junction object
- [Capacity Management Flows](./flows.md) - Implementing capacity check and container update flows
- [Validation Rules](./validation.md) - Implementing validation rules for capacity constraints

## Implementation Approach

The capacity management implementation follows these principles:

1. **Container-Based Tracking**: Inventory containers are treated as capacity-constrained resources
2. **Buffer Management**: Thresholds (30% and 70%) define buffer zones for capacity management
3. **Junction-Based Allocation**: Assignment__c serves as a junction between contracts, resources, and inventory
4. **Flow-Based Validation**: Automated flows enforce capacity constraints and update buffer status

## Documentation Consolidation

This section is part of the [Documentation Consolidation Initiative](../../project/consolidation-status.md) (April 3-11, 2025). Content is being migrated from individual implementation guides to create a more organized and consistent documentation structure.
