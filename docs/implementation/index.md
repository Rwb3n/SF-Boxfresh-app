This section provides detailed implementation guides for various components of the BoxFresh app. The guides are organized by functional area to make it easier to find relevant information.

## Capacity Management Implementation

The [capacity](./capacity/) section contains implementation guides for the Theory of Constraints (TOC) capacity management system, including:

- Field specifications
- Configuration steps
- Flow implementations
- Validation rules
- Testing procedures

## Future Implementation Areas

The following areas will be implemented after the completion of the documentation consolidation effort:

- [Security](./security/) - User profiles, permission sets, and field-level security
- [Cases](./cases/) - Case management for constraint issues
- [Reporting](./reporting/) - Reports and dashboards for constraint visibility

## Documentation Consolidation

This section is part of the [Documentation Consolidation Initiative](../consolidation/index.md) (April 3-11, 2025). Content is being migrated from multiple sources to create a more organized and consistent documentation structure.
