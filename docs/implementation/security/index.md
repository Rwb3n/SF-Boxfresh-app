# Security Implementation

This section provides implementation guides for security features in the BoxFresh app.

> **Note:** Security implementation is scheduled for Phase 2 (April 12 - May 17, 2025) following the documentation consolidation initiative.

## Planned Implementation Components

The security implementation will focus on:

- **User Role Configuration** - Creating and configuring appropriate user roles for field staff, managers, and clients
- **Permission Sets** - Implementing permission sets for different user types
- **Field-Level Security** - Configuring field-level security for sensitive data
- **Sharing Rules** - Implementing record sharing rules for client data
- **Authentication** - Setting up authentication mechanisms

## Implementation Approach

The security implementation will follow these key principles:

- **Least Privilege** - Users will have access only to data and functions necessary for their role
- **Role-Based Access** - Permissions will be granted based on clearly defined roles
- **Data Protection** - Client and business data will be protected according to industry standards
- **Auditability** - All security changes will be tracked and auditable

## Documentation Consolidation

This section is part of the [Documentation Consolidation Initiative](../../project/consolidation-status.md) (April 3-11, 2025). Content placeholders are being created in preparation for Phase 2 implementation.
