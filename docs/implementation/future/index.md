# Future Implementation Areas

This section provides placeholder documentation for future implementation areas of the BoxFresh app. These areas are planned for development after the completion of the current Theory of Constraints (TOC) capacity management implementation.

## Planned Implementation Areas

The following areas are scheduled for implementation in Phase 2 (April 19 - May 24, 2025) after the documentation consolidation effort:

### Security Implementation

The [Security Implementation](../security/) will focus on:

- User role configuration
- Permission sets for different user types
- Field-level security for sensitive data
- Sharing rules for client data
- Authentication mechanisms

### Case Management Implementation

The [Case Management Implementation](../cases/) will focus on:

- Case creation and assignment processes
- Service level agreements for different case types
- Escalation rules for unresolved cases
- Case templates for common case types
- Customer communication workflows

### Reporting Implementation

The [Reporting Implementation](../reporting/) will focus on:

- Capacity dashboards for resource monitoring
- Operational metrics for efficiency tracking
- Client-facing reports and dashboards
- Performance analytics for tracking and analysis
- Custom report types for specialized reporting

## Implementation Approach

All future implementation areas will follow the same general principles:

1. **Requirements Gathering** - Detailed stakeholder requirements
2. **Design & Planning** - Technical design and implementation planning
3. **Implementation** - Phased implementation of features
4. **Testing & Validation** - Comprehensive testing of functionality
5. **Documentation** - Complete documentation of implementation details
6. **Deployment** - Controlled release to production

## Documentation Consolidation

This section is part of the [Documentation Consolidation Initiative](../../project/consolidation-status.md) (April 3-11, 2025). Content placeholders are being created in preparation for Phase 2 implementation.
