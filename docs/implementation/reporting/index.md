# Reporting Implementation

This section provides implementation guides for reporting features in the BoxFresh app.

> **Note:** Reporting implementation is scheduled for Phase 2 (April 12 - May 17, 2025) following the documentation consolidation initiative.

## Planned Implementation Components

The reporting implementation will focus on:

- **Capacity Dashboard** - Creating dashboards to monitor resource capacity and constraints
- **Operational Metrics** - Implementing reports to track operational efficiency
- **Client Reports** - Designing client-facing reports and dashboards
- **Performance Analytics** - Setting up performance tracking and analysis tools
- **Custom Report Types** - Creating custom report types for specialized reporting needs

## Implementation Approach

The reporting implementation will follow these key principles:

- **Data-Driven Decision Making** - Reports will be designed to support informed business decisions
- **Real-Time Visibility** - Key metrics will be available in real-time where possible
- **Actionable Insights** - Reports will highlight areas requiring attention or intervention
- **User-Specific Views** - Different user roles will have appropriately tailored dashboards
- **Theory of Constraints Focus** - Reports will highlight system constraints and buffer status

## Documentation Consolidation

This section is part of the [Documentation Consolidation Initiative](../../consolidation/index.md) (April 3-11, 2025). Content placeholders are being created in preparation for Phase 2 implementation.
