# Utility Functions

This section provides reference documentation for utility functions used in the BoxFresh app. Utility functions are reusable code components that provide common functionality across different parts of the application.

## Key Utility Functions

- [LLM Integration](./llm.md) - Utilities for working with Large Language Models
- [Reporting](./reporting.md) - Utilities for report generation and dashboard components
- [Resource Management](./resources.md) - Utilities for resource allocation and management
- [Inventory Management](./inventory.md) - Utilities for inventory operations

## Using Utility Functions

Utility functions are designed to be reused across different implementation areas. Each utility function document includes:

- Function signatures and parameters
- Usage examples
- Error handling
- Performance considerations

## Documentation Consolidation

This section is part of the [Documentation Consolidation Initiative](../../project/consolidation-status.md) (April 3-11, 2025). Content is being migrated from multiple sources to create a more organized and consistent documentation structure.
