# Design Patterns

This section provides reference documentation for design patterns used in the BoxFresh app. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design.

## Key Design Patterns

- [Workflow Automation](./workflow.md) - Patterns for constraint-based workflow automation
- [Structured Data](./structure.md) - Patterns for structured data handling
- [Communication](./communication.md) - Patterns for customer and team communication
- [Agent-Based Automation](./agent.md) - Patterns for agent-based automation

## Using Design Patterns

When implementing new features, refer to these design patterns to ensure consistency across the application. Each pattern document includes:

- Pattern description and use cases
- Implementation examples
- Best practices
- Common pitfalls to avoid

## Documentation Consolidation

This section is part of the [Documentation Consolidation Initiative](../../project/consolidation-status.md) (April 3-11, 2025). Content is being migrated from multiple sources to create a more organized and consistent documentation structure.
