# Reference Documentation

This section provides reference documentation for the BoxFresh app, including design patterns and utility functions that can be used across different implementation areas.

## Key References

- [Design Patterns](./patterns/) - Implementation patterns for common BoxFresh app functionalities
- [Utility Functions](./utilities/) - Reusable utility functions for BoxFresh app development

## Using the Reference Section

The reference documentation is designed to be used as a companion to the implementation guides. While implementation guides provide step-by-step instructions for specific features, reference documentation explains the underlying patterns and utilities that are used across multiple features.

For example:
- If you're implementing capacity management flows, refer to the [Workflow](./patterns/workflow.md) design pattern
- If you're implementing customer notifications, refer to the [Communication](./patterns/communication.md) pattern
- If you need to work with LLM integrations, refer to the [LLM](./utilities/llm.md) utility functions

## Documentation Consolidation

This section is part of the [Documentation Consolidation Initiative](../project/consolidation-status.md) (April 3-11, 2025). Content is being migrated from multiple sources to create a more organized and consistent documentation structure.
