# BoxFresh App Documentation

**Documentation Consolidation Completed (April 11, 2025)**: All documentation has been successfully reorganized and consolidated. The project is now ready to proceed with Phase 2 implementation.

Welcome to the BoxFresh App documentation! This site contains comprehensive information about the BoxFresh application, a Salesforce-native solution for service scheduling and inventory management.

## Documentation Sections

- **[Overview](overview/)**: Core concepts, architecture, and schema
- **[Implementation](implementation/)**: Implementation guides and technical documentation
  - [Capacity Management](implementation/capacity/): TOC Implementation guides
- **[Project Management](project/)**: Status reports, sprint plans, and proposals
- **[Reference](reference/)**: Design patterns and utility functions
  - [Design Patterns](reference/patterns/): Implementation patterns used across the application
  - [Utility Functions](reference/utilities/): Common utilities and integration points

## Documentation Updates

The documentation site has been completely reorganized as part of our Documentation Consolidation Initiative. Key improvements include:

- **Improved Navigation Structure** - Logical grouping of related documentation
- **Streamlined Information Flow** - Better progression from concepts to implementation
- **Consolidated Content** - Reduced duplication and centralized information
- **Gap Analysis** - Identification and filling of documentation gaps

See the [consolidation status](project/consolidation-status.md) for details about this successfully completed initiative.

## Getting Started

New to BoxFresh? Start with these key documents:

1. [Core Concepts](overview/concepts.md) - Understand the Theory of Constraints approach
2. [System Architecture](overview/architecture.md) - Learn about system design
3. [Object Schema](overview/schema.md) - Explore the data model

## Recently Updated

- **April 11, 2025**: Completed Documentation Consolidation Initiative! All documentation has been successfully reorganized for Phase 2 implementation.
- **April 10, 2025**: Completed pruning of all deprecated files and directories for a cleaner repository
- **April 9, 2025**: Migrated utility function documentation ([LLM Integration](reference/utilities/llm.md), [Inventory Management](reference/utilities/inventory.md), [Resource Allocation](reference/utilities/resources.md), [Reporting System](reference/utilities/reporting.md))
- **April 8, 2025**: Migrated design pattern documentation ([Structured Data Model](reference/patterns/structure.md), [Workflow Automation](reference/patterns/workflow.md), [Customer Communication](reference/patterns/communication.md), [Field Agent System](reference/patterns/agent.md))
- **April 7, 2025**: Migrated project management documentation ([Project Status](project/status.md), [Sprint Plans](project/sprints/), [Consolidation Status](project/consolidation-status.md), [Implementation Proposals](project/proposals/))
- **April 6, 2025**: Completed capacity implementation guides ([Flows](implementation/capacity/flows.md), [Validation](implementation/capacity/validation.md))
- **April 5, 2025**: Added core overview documents (Architecture, Schema, Concepts) and initial capacity guides (Inventory, Stock, Junction)

## Current Focus: Theory of Constraints Implementation

The BoxFresh App is currently implementing inventory management based on the Theory of Constraints (TOC), treating inventory containers as capacity-constrained resources. This approach improves:

- **Resource Utilization**: Optimizing the use of containers and materials
- **Buffer Management**: Maintaining appropriate capacity buffers
- **Allocation Efficiency**: Ensuring materials are allocated where needed most

## Documentation Consolidation Initiative

**April 3-11, 2025**: We successfully completed our documentation consolidation initiative to improve organization and navigation.

**Final Update (April 11)**: All documentation has been successfully migrated to the new directory structure, with consolidated content and improved navigation. The key achievements:

- Directory structure reorganized for better navigation
- All content migrated to appropriate locations
- Redundant files consolidated and pruned
- Cross-references and links updated
- All deprecated files removed

See the [Documentation Consolidation Status](project/consolidation-status.md) for details on this effort.

## Core Documentation

- [Object Schema](overview/schema.md) - Object model definitions with capacity tracking fields
- [Flow Management](implementation/capacity/flows.md) - Data flow through the system
- [Communication Patterns](reference/patterns/communication.md) - Communication patterns
- [System Architecture](overview/architecture.md) - Overall system design

## Project Management
