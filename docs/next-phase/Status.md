# Next Phase Implementation Status

*Last Updated: April 2, 2025*

## Current Status: User Access, Communications, and Reporting Implementation

This document tracks the implementation status of the next phase of the BoxFresh app, focusing on Users and Permissions, Case/Communications management, and Reports and Dashboards to support the Theory of Constraints approach.

## Phase Overview

Following the implementation of core capacity management features, this phase will enhance:

- **User Access Controls**: Role-based security model with appropriate permissions
- **Communication Processes**: Automated notifications and case management for constraint issues
- **Visibility Tools**: Reports and dashboards to monitor system constraints

## Completed Items âœ…

### Documentation
- âœ… Created Next Phase Proposal
- âœ… Created Next Phase Status document (this document)
- âœ… Created Sprint Plan for next phase implementation

### Initial Assessment
- âœ… Identified key user roles for permission model
- âœ… Documented communication requirements for constraint management
- âœ… Cataloged essential reports and dashboards for TOC implementation

## In-Progress Items ðŸ”„

### Users and Permissions
- ðŸ”„ Designing role hierarchy
- ðŸ”„ Mapping field-level security requirements
- ðŸ”„ Documenting permission set specifications

### Case/Communications

## Current Sprint Status

| Task | Status | Due Date |
|------|--------|----------|
| Documentation: Create Next Phase Proposal | âœ… Completed | Apr 2 |
| Documentation: Create Next Phase Status | âœ… Completed | Apr 2 |
| Documentation: Create Sprint Plan | âœ… Completed | Apr 2 |
| Design: Define user permission matrix | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Apr 7 |
| Design: Document case process flows | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Apr 7 |
| Design: Create dashboard wireframes | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Apr 7 |
| Implementation: User Profiles & Permission Sets | ðŸ“… Planned | Apr 15 |
| Implementation: Case Automation | ðŸ“… Planned | Apr 22 |
| Implementation: TOC Dashboards | ðŸ“… Planned | Apr 29 |

## Risks and Issues

| Risk/Issue | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Role complexity may lead to excessive administrative overhead | Medium | Medium | Focus on streamlined permission sets over custom profiles |
| Case volume might overwhelm users without proper filtering | High | Medium | Implement careful escalation criteria and case categorization |
| Report performance issues with large data volumes | Medium | Medium | Optimize reports and consider using summary objects |
| Security model might be too restrictive for field operations | High | Medium | Conduct thorough user acceptance testing with field personnel |

## Next Steps

1. Complete the design documents for users and permissions matrix
2. Finalize communication template requirements
3. Complete dashboard wireframes for stakeholder review
4. Begin implementation of highest priority components (likely security model)
5. Schedule regular reviews to ensure alignment with TOC principles
