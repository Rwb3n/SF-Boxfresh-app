# Sprint Plans

This section serves as a guide to sprint plans for the BoxFresh app implementation. Each sprint plan outlines the specific tasks, timelines, and resources required for a particular implementation phase.

## Project Sprint Plans

Sprint plans are now maintained within their respective project folders:

- [01-TOC Implementation Sprint](../proposals/01-toc-implementation/sprint.md) - March 27 - April 18, 2025
- [02-Next Phase Sprint](../proposals/02-next-phase/sprint.md) - April 19 - May 24, 2025
- [03-Documentation Consolidation Sprint](../proposals/03-consolidation/sprint.md) - April 3 - April 11, 2025

Each sprint plan follows a standard format:

1. **Sprint Overview** - Summary of sprint goals and objectives
2. **Task Breakdown** - Detailed list of tasks with effort estimates
3. **Resource Allocation** - Team members assigned to each task
4. **Deliverables** - Expected outputs by the end of the sprint
5. **Risks and Mitigations** - Identified risks and mitigation strategies
6. **Dependencies** - Reliance on other components or external factors
