# Sprint Plans

This section contains detailed sprint plans for the BoxFresh app implementation. Each sprint plan outlines the specific tasks, timelines, and resources required for a particular implementation phase.

## Current Sprint

The current sprint focuses on the **Theory of Constraints (TOC) Implementation - Phase 1: Capacity Management**. This phase implements capacity tracking for inventory containers, treating them as capacity-constrained resources according to TOC principles.

- [Capacity Management Sprint](./capacity-sprint.md) - March 27 - April 18, 2025

## Upcoming Sprints

The following sprints are planned after the completion of the documentation consolidation effort:

- [Next Phase Sprint](./next-phase-sprint.md) - April 19 - May 24, 2025
  - Sprint 1: Design & Foundation (April 19-May 2)
  - Sprint 2: User Security Implementation (May 3-16)
  - Sprint 3: Automation & Dashboards (May 17-24)

## Sprint Planning Process

Each sprint plan follows a standard format:

1. **Sprint Overview** - Summary of sprint goals and objectives
2. **Task Breakdown** - Detailed list of tasks with effort estimates
3. **Resource Allocation** - Team members assigned to each task
4. **Deliverables** - Expected outputs by the end of the sprint
5. **Risks and Mitigations** - Identified risks and mitigation strategies
6. **Dependencies** - Reliance on other components or external factors

## Documentation Consolidation

This section is part of the [Documentation Consolidation Initiative](../../consolidation/index.md) (April 3-11, 2025). Content is being migrated from multiple sources to create a more organized and consistent documentation structure.
