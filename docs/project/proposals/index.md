# Implementation Proposals

This section contains detailed implementation proposals for the BoxFresh app. Each proposal outlines the rationale, approach, and implementation plan for a specific feature or component.

## Current Project Proposals

The BoxFresh app implementation is organized into distinct phases, each with its own implementation proposal:

- [01-TOC Implementation](01-toc-implementation/) - Theory of Constraints implementation for inventory management
- [02-Next Phase Implementation](02-next-phase/) - User access, case management, and reporting capabilities

## Proposal Structure

Each implementation proposal includes:

1. **Executive Summary** - Brief overview of the proposed implementation
2. **Business Rationale** - Explanation of the business need and expected benefits
3. **Technical Approach** - Detailed technical implementation plan
4. **Component Breakdown** - Outline of specific components to be developed
5. **Timeline** - Proposed implementation timeline with key milestones
6. **Resource Requirements** - Required development and testing resources
7. **Risks and Mitigations** - Potential risks and mitigation strategies

## Proposal Process

New implementation proposals are developed through the following process:

1. **Initial Draft** - Development team creates initial proposal based on business requirements
2. **Technical Review** - Peer review by technical team members
3. **Stakeholder Review** - Review and feedback from business stakeholders
4. **Final Approval** - Final review and approval by project governance board
5. **Implementation** - Creation of sprint plans and implementation tasks

Approved proposals serve as the foundation for sprint planning and development activities.

## Future Proposals

Future proposals will be developed for additional features and enhancements to the BoxFresh app.
