## Effort Legend
- S: Small (0.5-1 day)
- M: Medium (1-2 days)
- L: Large (2-3 days)

## Definition of Done

Sprint deliverables will be considered complete when:

1. **Directory Structure**
   - All documentation files are moved to the appropriate directories
   - Main index is updated to reflect the new structure
   - Redirects are in place for backward compatibility
   - All new directories contain appropriate index files

2. **Content Consolidation**
   - All identified redundancies are eliminated
   - Consolidated files maintain all unique information from source files
   - All content follows standardized templates
   - Consolidated files have been reviewed for completeness

3. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - All documents have executive summaries where appropriate
   - Cross-references and related links are functioning
   - Navigation elements are consistent across all documents
   - Link validation shows zero broken internal links

## Success Metrics

The sprint will be considered successful if:

1. 100% of documentation is migrated to the new structure
2. Duplication is reduced by at least 70%
3. Maximum navigation depth to any document is 3 clicks or fewer
4. Documentation passes quality review with fewer than 5 minor issues

## Dependencies

- Access to all existing documentation sources
- Agreement on the final structure from all stakeholders
- Technical resources available for redirect mechanism
- Subject matter experts available for content review

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Loss of information during consolidation | Maintain original files until final approval; use version control |
| Timeline slippage due to scope expansion | Strictly prioritize tasks; defer enhancements to follow-up sprints if needed |
| Disagreements on structure | Finalize structure in initial kickoff; escalate promptly if issues arise |
| Link breakage | Comprehensive link validation before and after each phase |

## Daily Check-in Schedule

- 15-minute daily stand-up at 9:00 AM
- End-of-day progress update by 4:30 PM
- Phase transition reviews at completion of each phase

## Approval Process

At the completion of each phase:
1. Technical review by Tech Lead
2. Content review by Documentation Lead
3. User acceptance testing where applicable
4. Formal sign-off before proceeding to next phase
