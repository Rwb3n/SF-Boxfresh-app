# Implementation Notes

This document captures key decisions, issues, and resolutions during the implementation of the BoxFresh App schema.

## Documentation Clarifications

| Date     | Topic   | Decision/Clarification                             | Impact                                          |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 27/03/25 | phase 1 | following protocol to the best of my ability       |                                                 |
| 28/03/25 | naming  | decided to use **"bf_"** prefix for future objects | High - prevents conflicts with standard objects |

## Implementation Decisions

| Date     | Object/Field             | Decision                                    | Rationale                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 28/03/25 | **Resource_Gear__c**     | Added new object                            | To better segregate different types of assets (equipment, tools, uniforms) |
| 28/03/25 | **Service_Agreement__c** | Split into **Core** and **Element** objects | Better organization of service agreement components                        |
| 28/03/25 | **Property__c**          | Removed                                     | Redundant with **Service_Location__c**                                     |
| 28/03/25 | **Material_Stock__c**    | Added status tracking fields                | Improved visibility of stock lifecycle                                     |
| 28/03/25 | **Inventory__c**         | Removed **Location__c field**               | Using **Resource_Asset__c** lookup instead for better data model           |

## Issues and Resolutions

| Date     | Issue                                      | Resolution                                         | Status   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 28/03/25 | Object naming conflicts                    | Decided to use **"bf_"** prefix for future objects | Resolved |
| 28/03/25 | Unit of measure inconsistencies will arise | Identified need for a **normalization function**   | Pending  |
| 28/03/25 | Property vs Service Location confusion     | Consolidated into **Service_Location__c**          | Resolved |

## Testing Notes

| Date     | Test Scenario              | Result  | Follow-up Actions               |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| 28/03/25 | Material Category creation | Success | Need to test with SKUs          |
| 28/03/25 | Material SKU creation      | Success | Need to test relationships      |
| 28/03/25 | Material Stock creation    | Success | Need to test status transitions |

## Optimization Opportunities

| Date     | Area              | Suggested Optimization                            | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 28/03/25 | Unit Conversion   | Create normalization function for different units | High     |
| 28/03/25 | Status Tracking   | Implement path for visual status progression      | Medium   |
| 28/03/25 | Naming Convention | Add "bf_" prefix to all custom objects            | High     |

## General Notes

- Implementation follows the sequence specified in the [Implementation Plan](SF-Boxfresh-app/docs/project/proposals/05-sprint1/plan.md) to respect object dependencies.
- All decisions are made in alignment with the specifications in the [Object Schema](../../../overview/schema.md) document.
- Any deviations from the documented schema will be recorded here with justifications.

### Key Learnings
1. Always use a prefix for custom objects to avoid conflicts with standard objects
2. Consider data model implications when adding new fields
3. Plan for unit conversion scenarios early in the design phase

### Next Steps
1. Complete page layouts for foundation objects
2. Begin field implementation for intermediate objects
3. Develop unit conversion function
4. Schedule blitz stand-up for Resource_Gear__c alignment
