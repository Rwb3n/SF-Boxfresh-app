# Theory of Constraints Implementation

*Last Updated: April 11, 2025*

## Overview

This section contains documentation for the Theory of Constraints (TOC) implementation project for the BoxFresh App. The TOC implementation focuses on inventory management based on Eliyahu Goldratt's Theory of Constraints principles, treating inventory containers as capacity-constrained resources.

## Key Documents

- [Implementation Proposal](SF-Boxfresh-app/docs/project/proposals/01-toc-implementation/proposal.md) - Detailed implementation plan for TOC inventory management
- [Sprint Plan](sprint.md) - Sprint details for capacity management implementation

## Core Features

The TOC implementation delivers the following core features:

1. **Capacity Fields** - Custom fields for tracking container capacity
2. **Assignment Junction** - Enhanced assignment object as a junction between contracts and inventory
3. **Capacity Flows** - Automated flows for validation and capacity management
4. **Buffer Management** - Automated buffer management for inventory optimization

## Timeline

- **Planning**: March 20-26, 2025 ✅
- **Sprint 1**: March 27 - April 10, 2025 ✅
- **Review**: April 11, 2025 ✅

## Current Status

The TOC implementation has been successfully completed, delivering all planned features on schedule. The system now efficiently tracks and manages inventory capacity using Theory of Constraints principles.
