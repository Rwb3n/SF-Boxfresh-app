# BoxFresh App: Capacity Management Sprint Plan

*Sprint Duration: 2 weeks (March 27 - April 10, 2025)*

## Sprint Goal

Implement core Theory of Constraints principles for inventory capacity management with minimal overhead and maximum impact.

## Focus Areas

1. Essential capacity fields for inventory containers
2. Basic buffer management
3. Critical workflow documentation

## Sprint Backlog

### Documentation (3 days)

1. **Update workflow.md**
   - Focus on capacity constraint concepts
   - Remove expiry tracking references
   - Add simple container capacity diagrams
   
2. **Update schema.md**
   - Document new capacity fields
   - Document assignment junction relationships

### Schema Implementation (4 days)

1. **Inventory Container Fields**
   - Add `Capacity_Units__c` (Number)
   - Add `Available_Units__c` (Formula)
   
2. **Material Stock Fields**
   - Add `Units_Consumed__c` (Number)
   - Add validation rule for capacity limits

3. **Assignment Enhancement**
   - Set up proper junction relationships

### Workflow Automation (5 days)

1. **Capacity Check Flow**
   - Create simple validation on material stock creation
   - Alert when container capacity exceeds 70%
   
2. **Assignment Flow**
   - Link inventory container to assignments
   - Track capacity allocation

3. **Dashboard Component**
   - Single component showing container capacity usage

## Not In Scope

- Full dashboard suite
- Advanced buffer management
- Complex constraint identification
- User training documentation
- Test automation

## Daily Check-in Questions

1. What capacity constraint features did I complete yesterday?
2. What am I working on today?
3. Are there any blockers to implementing capacity tracking?

## Definition of Done

- Capacity fields added to objects
- Basic validation preventing capacity overages
- Updated documentation reflecting TOC approach
- Simple dashboard component for capacity visualization

## Success Metrics

- All materials have units consumed values
- All containers have capacity limits
- No container can be allocated beyond capacity
- Assignment records correctly link resources and inventory

## Next Steps Post-Sprint

- Buffer management refinement
- Constraint identification automation
- Throughput measurement
- Advanced reporting

## Documentation Consolidation
