# Project Status

*Last Updated: April 6, 2025*

## Current Focus

The BoxFresh app is currently focused on the **Theory of Constraints (TOC) Implementation - Phase 1: Capacity Management**. This phase treats inventory containers as capacity-constrained resources and implements capacity management workflows.

In parallel, we have launched the **Documentation Consolidation Initiative** to reorganize and improve our documentation structure.

## Documentation Consolidation Initiative (April 3-11, 2025)

The documentation consolidation initiative is making good progress:

| Milestone           | Status         | Notes                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Planning            | ✅ Completed    | Consolidation plan and file mapping completed                  |
| Directory Structure | ✅ Completed    | All directories created                                        |
| Index Files         | ✅ Completed    | All index files created                                        |
| Content Migration   | 🟡 In Progress | Capacity management guides completed; project docs in progress |
| Content Review      | ⏳ Not Started  | Scheduled for April 8                                          |
| Gap Analysis        | ⏳ Not Started  | Scheduled for April 9                                          |
| Deprecation         | 🟡 In Progress | Added notices to original files as migration occurs            |
| Final Review        | ⏳ Not Started  | Scheduled for April 11                                         |

## TOC Implementation Progress

### Completed Items

#### Documentation
- ✅ Updated schema documentation to include capacity fields for `Inventory__c` and `Material_Stock__c`
- ✅ Revised workflow documentation to focus on container capacity management
- ✅ Added TOC references to `index.md` and `README.md`
- ✅ Created implementation proposal for TOC implementation strategy
- ✅ Created sprint plan for implementation timeline
- ✅ Created implementation guides for capacity fields
- ✅ Created next phase planning documents
- ✅ Created documentation consolidation plan

#### Schema Design
- ✅ Designed capacity fields for `Inventory__c`
- ✅ Designed capacity fields for `Material_Stock__c`
- ✅ Defined `Assignment__c` as junction object between contracts, resources, and inventory

### Current Sprint Status

| Task | Status | Due Date |
|------|--------|----------|
| Documentation Consolidation | 🟡 In Progress | April 11, 2025 |
| Adding capacity fields to `Inventory__c` | 🔄 In Progress | April 12, 2025 |
| Adding capacity fields to `Material_Stock__c` | 🔄 In Progress | April 13, 2025 |
| Enhancing Assignment__c junction | 🔄 In Progress | April 14, 2025 |
| Creating Capacity Check Flow | 📅 Planned | April 15, 2025 |
| Creating Container Update Flow | 📅 Planned | April 16, 2025 |
| Creating capacity dashboard component | 📅 Planned | April 18, 2025 |

### Next Steps

After completing the documentation consolidation:

1. Complete implementation of capacity fields on `Inventory__c` and `Material_Stock__c` objects
2. Build validation rules to enforce capacity constraints
3. Implement flows for capacity management, beginning with the Capacity Check Flow
4. Create dashboard components for visualizing capacity utilization
5. Conduct thorough testing of all components
6. Begin design phase for next implementation sprint (user access, cases, and reporting)

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Capacity Management (Current)
- **March 27 - April 18, 2025**: Implementation of TOC capacity fields and flows

### Documentation Consolidation
- **April 3 - April 11, 2025**: Restructuring and enhancement of documentation

### Phase 2: User Access, Cases, and Reporting (Pending Consolidation)
- **April 19 - May 24, 2025**: Implementation of user security, case management, and dashboards
  - Sprint 1: Design & Foundation (April 19-May 2)
  - Sprint 2: User Security Implementation (May 3-16)
  - Sprint 3: Automation & Dashboards (May 17-24)

## Current Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Documentation consolidation delays implementation | Medium | Low | Detailed consolidation plan with clear timeline |
| Capacity management complexity increases development time | High | Medium | Phased approach with focus on core functionality first |
| Integration with existing inventory processes causes conflicts | Medium | Medium | Thorough testing and validation of new workflows |
| Complex capacity calculations may impact performance | High | Medium | Consider using Apex triggers for performance-critical operations |
| Data migration for existing records | High | Medium | Create a data migration plan with careful validation steps |
