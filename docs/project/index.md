# Project Management

This section contains project management documents for the BoxFresh app, including status reports, roadmaps, sprint plans, and implementation proposals.

## Key Documents

- [Project Status](./status.md) - Current implementation status
- [Project Roadmap](./roadmap.md) - Long-term implementation plan
- [Sprint Plans](./sprints/) - Sprint plan overview and reference

## Implementation Projects

The BoxFresh app implementation is organized into distinct project phases:

- [01-TOC Implementation](./proposals/01-toc-implementation/) - Theory of Constraints implementation for inventory management
- [02-Next Phase Implementation](./proposals/02-next-phase/) - User access, case management, and reporting capabilities
- [03-Documentation Consolidation](./proposals/03-consolidation/) - Documentation reorganization and improvement

## Project Organization

All implementation projects follow a consistent structure:

1. **Proposal** - Detailed implementation plan outlining approach, components, and timeline
2. **Sprint** - Sprint details including tasks, resources, and deliverables
3. **Index** - Overview of the project status and key information

Projects are numbered according to their implementation sequence, with each project containing its own documentation and resources.
