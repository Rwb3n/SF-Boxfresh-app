## üåø[BoxFresh Gardens]
Automated Service Scheduling, Inventory & Resource Management, and Customer Communication
A showcase of ADM201 Salesforce Administration skills: Service Cloud, Flow Automation, Data Management & Security.

## üèµÔ∏è [Overview]
This project is a Salesforce-native prototype designed to showcase the skills gained from my ADM certification and my independent problem-solving ability. It optimizes workflow through elegant schema design, flow automation, and real-time reporting, following Salesforce best practices.

### Why
**This is how it began:** 
### "Alright. I finished ADM201. Now what?"

I see people applying for Salesforce roles with stacked credentials‚Äîpapers. I get it. If nothing else, those certs show tenacity. So how do I counter that? I need to prove the same thing‚Äîbut in my own way.

A portfolio? Fine. But not just some vague automation flow. That won‚Äôt show initiative. That won‚Äôt show grit.
If I want to stand out, I need something real‚Äîsomething that proves I can build, problem-solve, and execute.

So I‚Äôll do this: I‚Äôll go back. Back to BoxFresh Gardens, my old business, where I lost the game because I lacked systems. And I‚Äôll rebuild it‚Äînot in the real world, but in Salesforce. 
Everything I was missing, every blind spot, every inefficiency that choked my margins‚ÄîI‚Äôll attempt to fix it.

If I had this back then, would I have survived? Maybe. But that‚Äôs not the point. The point is, I‚Äôll prove I can do what actually matters in this space: Design. Build. Solve. Execute.

### Rewind...

I set out to build a life in the sun, hands in the earth, scaling from private gardens to high-end contracts. I recruited a team of workhorses who took me further than ever before, but my grip wasn‚Äôt strong enough. Systems failed, cracks widened, and I collapsed under the weight of my own ambition. This project is my autopsy, a reconstruction of what was missing‚Äîstructured automation, resource control, and precision execution. My failures sharpened my insights, and now, this portfolio is proof of the value I bring to ambitious teams in the Salesforce space.
