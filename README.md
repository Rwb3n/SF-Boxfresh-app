## Latest Update: Theory of Constraints Implementation
The BoxFresh app now implements Eliyahu Goldratt's Theory of Constraints principles for inventory management, treating inventory containers as capacity-constrained resources. This approach optimizes throughput and ensures efficient material allocation. See the [Implementation Proposal](https://github.com/Rwb3n/SF-Boxfresh-app/blob/main/docs/Proposal.md) and [Current Sprint Plan](https://github.com/Rwb3n/SF-Boxfresh-app/blob/main/docs/Sprint-Plan.md) for details.

## üåø[BoxFresh Gardens]
Automated Service Scheduling, Inventory & Resource Management, and Customer Communication
A showcase of ADM201 Salesforce Administration skills: Service Cloud, Flow Automation, Data Management & Security.

## üèµÔ∏è [Overview]
This project is a Salesforce-native prototype designed to showcase the skills gained from my ADM certification and my independent problem-solving ability. It optimizes workflow through elegant schema design, flow automation, and real-time reporting, following Salesforce best practices.

### Why
**This is how it began:** 
### "Alright. I passed ADM201. Now what?"

I see people applying for Salesforce roles with stacked credentials‚Äîpapers. I get it. If nothing else, those certs show tenacity. So how do I counter that? I need to prove the same thing‚Äîbut in my own way, I have no choice.

A portfolio. But not just some vague automation flow. That won't show initiative. If I want to stand out, I need something real‚Äîsomething that proves I can build, problem-solve, and execute.

So I'll do this: I'll go back. Back to BoxFresh Gardens, my old business, where I lost the game because I lacked systems, amongst other aspects. And I'll rebuild it‚Äînot in the real world, but in Salesforce. 
Everything I think was missing, every blind spot, every inefficiency‚ÄîI'll attempt to fix it.

If I had this back then, would I have survived? Maybe. That's not the point. The point is I'll prove I can do what actually matters in this space. Design. Build. Solve. Execute. Get hired!

### Let's rewind for a moment...

Back then I set out to build a life in the sun, hands in the earth, scaling from private gardens to high-end contracts. 
I recruited a team of workhorses who took me further than ever before, but my grip wasn't strong enough. Systems failed, cracks widened, and I collapsed under the weight of my own ambition.

This project is my autopsy, a reconstruction of what was missing‚Äîstructured automation, resource control, and precision execution. 
My failures sharpened my insights, and now, this portfolio is proof of the value I might bring to ambitious teams in the Salesforce space.üöÄ

## üî∂ [Scenario]
A small service-based business (Boxfresh Gardens) needs a Salesforce-powered service management system that automates inventory & resource management, job assignment, and reporting. This prototype solves that problem using a declarative based Salesforce customization, ensuring a scalable, effective CRM solution.

## [Features & Capabilities]
- ‚úÖ Service Cloud Configuration ‚Äì Custom Case Lifecycle, automated status tracking
- ‚úÖ Flow Automation ‚Äì Automatically assigns requests to resource units based on availability
- ‚úÖ Reports & Dashboards ‚Äì Provides real-time insights into job tracking, inventory, and performance analysis
- ‚úÖ User & Data Security ‚Äì Custom profiles, permission sets, and sharing rules
- ‚úÖ Lightning UI Customization ‚Äì Page layouts, paths, quick actions, and record types
- ‚úÖ Theory of Constraints ‚Äì Inventory capacity management, buffer tracking, and throughput optimization

## üî® [Technical Breakdown]
This POC includes Salesforce-native features without custom code:
### üîπ Custom Schema
    - Custom Objects: Material SKU, Inventory, Custom Contract, 
      Resource, Asset, Resource Unit, Assignment, Work Order
    - Standard Objects Used: Case, Account, Contact
    - Capacity Management: Inventory containers with capacity constraints, material stock with capacity consumption
### üîπ Automation
    - Flow Builder: Case Routing Flow, Escalation Flow, Capacity Management Flow
    - Approval Processes: Purchase Order Approvals
    - Validation Rules: Ensuring capacity limits aren't exceeded, proper inventory allocation
### üîπ Security & Access
    - Profiles & Permission Sets: Role-based access for Admins, Technicians, and Managers
    - Sharing Rules: Restricting job visibility to assigned teams only
### üîπ Analytics & Insights
    - Reports & Dashboards: Inventory Analysis, Job Completion Rate, Technician Performance, Capacity Utilization
