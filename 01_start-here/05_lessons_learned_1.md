## What I *think* I got right
I spent a fair amount of time designing a lean information capture framework for future reference. I wanted to ensure I was thinking in systems from the start. 
Key points:
- Structured Information Capture - A framework to build on at each step.
- Traceability & Success Metrics - Measurement of what a win is.
- Iterative thinking - Encourage improvement at each step.

## Where I *think* I went wrong
My initial systems were imprecise.
key points:
- Spent a lot of time on the documentation before execution.
- My perfectionism streak fell easily into procrastination territory. Too many times I was duplicating effort.
- Moving forward; focus on a minimum viable system, magnify on a specific function and build it entirely.
- I **severely** underestimated system complexity, my information capture was not enough.
- As soon as I began designing, followed by building the schema, I understood the importance of an important philosophy:
  - (sure...) expect the best, (BUT...!) Plan for the worst.
  - I learned a important, high value, paradigm for the future - Systems Resillience. Build systems for graceful failure, and recovery.
  - feedback is important (in this case my own), and I had to consider automation from the start.
