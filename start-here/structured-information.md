  - Manager creates service schedules, coordinates weekly rotas, manages communication with clients, suppliers, and teams. 
  - Supervisor oversees daily operations, quality control, and resource requests. 
  - Supervisor reports to Manager, who interfaces with clients.
- **Team Structure:** 
  - One team comprising 1 manager, 1 supervisor, covering one route. 
  - Work schedule includes: 
    - 2 days large residential estate, 
    - 1 day medium residential estate, 
    - 2 days private properties (3 properties/day, 1-2 hours each), 
    - and allocated admin/maintenance time.

### 1b) Pain Points & Inefficiencies
- Administrative overhead from manual scheduling, communication, and inventory management.
- Limited capacity to scale due to lack of digital systems.
- Inefficient resource allocation and duplicate reporting.
- High administrative workload reduces operational productivity.

### 1c) Growth Objectives
- Expand to multiple teams (each with at least 1 supervisor and 2 operatives) serving multiple residential/commercial estates.
- Implement inventory, resource, expense, and job management systems.
- Transition to a hybrid manual/automated client communication system.
- Prototype system within weeks; full deployment within 3 months.
- Reduce administrative overhead and increase scalability through digital transformation.

### 1d) Resource Constraints
- Rising costs of materials, equipment, salaries, and staffing.
- High turnover (churn) among staff and clients necessitating administrative efficiency.
- Urgency for rapid deployment (3-month timeline) may strain current operational resources.

## 2) Process Documentation

### 2a) Core Biz Workflows
- **Service Scheduling:** Managed weekly by Manager, implemented by Supervisor.

- **Issue Escalation:** Operative reports issues to Supervisor; Supervisor escalates significant issues to Manager.

### 2b) System Interactions
- Supervisor interacts with Manager for scheduling, resource procurement, and issue escalation.
- Operatives provide daily task completion data and equipment logs to Supervisor.
- Supervisor submits weekly operational reports to Manager.

### 2c) Data Requirements
- Inventory levels, resource usage, and requests
- Daily task completion and time logs
- Client feedback and satisfaction ratings
- Quality control documentation (photos, sketches, site logs)
